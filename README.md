# AI SparkDev Fall 2020 Website

### Authors: Maria De Jesus Rivera, Marina Alonzo

#### Overview
Created with the purpose of showcasing the Sentiment Analysis AI created by the AI SparkDev Team.

#### Purpose
Allows for the quick viewing of what the Sentiment Analysis AI accomplishes. Any integer from one to one million is inputted, and the review before and after pre-processing* is displayed along with the sentiment value (0 being bad, 1 being good). 

*Pre-processing*: the process of removing numbers, punctuation and "stop-words" such as like, the, or, etc. as well as lemmatizing (stemming) the words to allow for more efficient tokenization and in turn a more accurate sentiment analysis

#### Tools Utilized
- **Flask**: Used to connect the front-end with the back-end. Can be said to be the intermediary between the two
- **WTForms**: Submodule within Flask to be able to process the form within the website efficiently and effectively
- **VSCode**: The IDE used to program both the python files and the html files.
- **Coolors.co**: An AI based color scheme creator, to generate colors for any website or design
- **Languages used**:
    > **Python**: Used for backend such as for the reading in of the csv files which contains model and database information  
    > **HTML**: Used to develop the front-end of the website as a whole.  
    > **CSS**: Used to style the website and create a versatile, yet streamlined interface that is easy for users to understand and interact with.  

#### Challenges during Development
Although there were many challenges and hurdles to get through in order to achieve the end product, they were all surpassed and much was learned.
Challenges faced:
  > **Front-end Back-end connection**: The process of developing a front-end, and developing a back-end separately was not complicated, rather the actual connecting of the two was what was most complex. This is where Flask comes in, greatly simplifying the entire process and providing extremely useful dataframes and modules to allow for more efficient form reading and processing.
  
  > **Managing Code Organization and Legibility**: While working with the code, it could be complicated to keep the code clean and maintaining the legibility of it, to ensure that other developers could clearly understand what each line of code would do. One key example of this was a large amount of div tags that could be found throughout the code, which could cause confusion. The code was cleared up, and allowed for more clear understanding of the project as a whole.  
  
  > **Learning while Doing**: Throughout the entire creation process of this website, we had little to no experience in web development, which then required for us to learn what we were doing and why while working on the website itself. Nonetheless, plenty was learned, and skills were acquired in the making of this.
 
#### Learning Outcomes
Of course, skills in web development involving coding HTML and CSS from scratch were learnt. Additionally, the actual process of developing front-end and back-end as well as combining them to create a fully functional webpage was learned. The skills acquired within this project will be sure to be used and expanded upon in the future endeavors and projects to come.
